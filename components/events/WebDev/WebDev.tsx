            The event kicks off with an MCQ round covering the fundamentals of web development. Participants will answer 
            30 questions, testing their knowledge and preparation. The top performers will then advance to the second 
            round, where they will build a website based on provided requirements, allowing them to demonstrate their 
            practical skills.
