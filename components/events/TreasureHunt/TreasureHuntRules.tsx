      <ol className="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400 text-base md:text-xl font-sans max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        <li>
          <b>Crew Formation:</b><br />
          Each pirate crew must consist of 1 to 4 members, with a recommended crew size of 3 Straw Hats to
          efficiently navigate the Grand Line of challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Rounds of Adventure:</b><br />
          The treasure hunt consists of 5 rounds. Each round provides cryptic clues that guide you to the next island (location).
          The last island will have an unknown activity to attain your Jolly Roger (flag).
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Time to Set Sail:</b><br />
          Crews have 20 minutes to complete the voyage, with 5 minutes allocated to each island (location). Time
          management is critical, but remember: the entire quest must be finished before the sun sets on the seas (within the given time).
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Cheating is Forbidden by the World Government:</b><br />
          Our Marine officers (volunteers) will keep a close eye on the pirate crews. Any attempt to cheat will lead to
          immediate disqualification, and the crew will be thrown into Impel Down!
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Denden Mushi Prohibited:</b><br />
          The use of mobile phones, Denden Mushi (transponder snail), and any other electronic communication
          devices is strictly forbidden. True pirates rely on their wits, not technology!
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Pirate King&apos;s Challenge:</b><br />
          Victory depends on completing the quest within the given time frame. The fastest pirate crew will be
          declared the winners and crowned as the new Pirate King!
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Tech-Savvy Pirates:</b><br />
          Some knowledge of technology will be needed to solve the clues, though not all puzzles will require tech. A
          well-rounded pirate crew will stand a better chance!
        </li>
        <li>
          <br /><b>Inspiration from Pirate Competitions:</b><br />
          This treasure hunt is designed to challenge your wits, teamwork, and pirate instincts. Just like in the fierce
          battles for treasure across the Grand Line, you&apos;ll need courage, cunning, and cooperation to claim victory and
          make your mark on history!

        As Gol D. Roger once declared, <i>&ldquo;Inherited will, the swelling of the changing times, 
        and the dreams of people&mdash;these are things that cannot be stopped.&rdquo;</i>
